ls -l
file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number of bytes in the file,
     abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the pathname.  In addition, for each directory whose
     contents are displayed, the total number of 512-byte blocks used by the files in the directory is displayed on a line by itself, immediately before the information


-l total
-r needs to reverse the other sorting if there are others ie. -tr
./ft_ls includes/ft_ls.h, ls'ing a file doesn't work
-LEAKS
-t doesn't quite organize properly, ./ft_ls -t libft/srcs/
